 Joplin Testing Documents
=========================

Welcome to the Joplin testing documents repository. This README serves as an introduction and guide to navigate the various testing materials we have prepared for Joplin. Our goal is to maintain thorough, reliable, and consistent tests covering multiple aspects of our application.

### Getting Started

To start working with the testing suite, follow these instructions to configure your environment and run tests.

<a name="setup-environment"></a>

#### Setup Environment

1. Install Node.js and npm. Visit <https://nodejs.org/en/> for installation instruction.
2. Clone the Joplin repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/joplin.git`
3. Change into the cloned repository: `cd joplin`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`

<a name="running-tests"></a>

#### Running Tests

Run the full test suite using the following command:
```lua
npm test
```
You can filter individual test categories by adding arguments after the `npm test` command, for example:

* Unit tests: `npm test -- --unit`
* Integration tests: `npm test -- --integration`
* End-to-End tests: `npm test -- --e2e`

<a name="test-types"></a>

### Test Types

We categorize tests into three groups according to their scope and purpose.

<a name="unit-tests"></a>

#### Unit Tests

These tests target small pieces of functionality, typically single functions. They focus on isolated components and validate expected behavior when inputs vary.

<a name="integration-tests"></a>

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests examine interactions among different parts of the system. Their primary objective is to evaluate compatibility and consistency between interdependent modules.

<a name="end-to-end-tests"></a>

#### End-to-End Tests

End-to-End (E2E) tests simulate user interaction, traversing multiple layers of the stack. E2E tests aim to assess overall experience and detect integration discrepancies.

<a name="writing-new-tests"></a>

### Writing New Tests

When writing new tests, adhere to these guidelines and best practices.

<a name="guidelines"></a>

#### Guidelines

1. Separate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into distinct folders.
2. Use descriptive filenames and titles.
3. Isolate failures by keeping tests independent.
4. Provide clear error messages.
5. Strive for concise yet expressive assertions.

<a name="best-practices"></a>

#### Best Practices

1. Focus tests on critical edge cases.
2. Mock third-party API responses.
3. Implement positive and negative test cases.
4. Refactor repetitive logic in helper methods.
5. Leverage continuous integration (CI) pipelines.

<a name="code-coverage-analysis"></a>

### Code Coverage Analysis

Monitor code coverage percentages throughout development. High code coverage indicates fewer untested lines, increasing confidence in the stability of the application. Consider integrating reporting plugins into your preferred editor or IDE.

<a name="contribution-guidelines"></a>

### Contribution Guidelines

Pull requests welcoming contributions that improve our testing suite, fix broken tests, or refine our methodologies. When submitting PRs, please format your commits consistently and accompany them with explanatory descriptions. We appreciate your efforts in strengthening the Joplin ecosystem. Happy testing!
